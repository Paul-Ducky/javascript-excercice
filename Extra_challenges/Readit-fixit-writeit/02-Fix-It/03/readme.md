# FIX IT
## EX 03
* Why are we not seeing any tv shows? Look at the error message in the dev tools and solve it.
* Try to display the list on the screen in reversed order. (without adjusting the original array)

* the array wasn't being used by the code --> changed 'movies' into 'tvshows'.

*  I used `array.reverse()` to turn the array around without creating a new one or any other extra code.
