## EX 12
* Notice the difference with the previous exercise.
* Why is there no 'return' in the parseMovieData function?

## The arrow function has a return by default!
If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the `return` keyword!

it looks as if there are 3 values to be returned, however becuse of the `+` between each of them, they are turned into one big value!
