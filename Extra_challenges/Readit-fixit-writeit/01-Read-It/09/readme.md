* Notice how the 2 map functions are attached to eachother, this is called 'method chaining'

* What does the parseTitle function do exactly?

* Notice how all the code is in the shape of functions.

The method chaining is a nice thing, lowering the amount of variables in use, to store "steps".

The structure of the chain maintains a nice overview of all the steps in this way and keeps the code nice and tidy to read!

The parseTitle function will put every title in the array in lowercase, except for the titles that start with the word "the" Those titles are put in uppercase and logged to the console.
