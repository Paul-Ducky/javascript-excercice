* Look at the documentation of the map() function
* What's the difference between this and the previous exercise?

** The `map()` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. **


in the previous exercise we didn't create a new constant array in however this creates options as you can now choose between 2, 1 is the normal list, the other is lower cased.
