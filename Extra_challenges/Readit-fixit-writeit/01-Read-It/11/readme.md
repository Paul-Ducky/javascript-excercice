# READ IT
## EX 11
* What's the difference with the previous exercises? What are we dealing with here?
* Where exactly do we define to only render the title

#
### We are now dealing with an array of objects!
Each object is assigned one or more properties which then become readable.

This is how we only rendered the titles from the list of objects which hold the title as one of their properties.

Eg: `movie.title.toLowerCase()`

###
using this we made an array of the titles in lowercase which we then immediately wrapped with `<li></li>` tags and joined with no commas!
