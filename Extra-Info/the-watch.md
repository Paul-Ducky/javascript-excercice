# The watch

The watch is a moment of 10 to 15 minutes, each day after the break, where the junior gives a presentation or live code demo about anything tech related.
Possible subjects are Tech news, programming languages, how to manage a server, ...

When in doubt if something is suitable for the Watch, feel free to ask your coach.

Important to note is that you are not required to use a powerpoint, you can be creative and use different ways of enhancing your watch (making a game, using a quiz). Just be prepared for the question of the coach why you choose this way of presentation.

# Order of the watch

Always be prepared for the next 3 watches.
This means that if you have a watch on Wednesday, you should be able to give your talk on Monday.

**If you are in class but are not prepared, you will have to give an extra watch!**

# Tips

## Practice
* Practice with the beamer at least once
* Practice what you are going to say at least once, preferably with someone listening

## Slides/other media
* Use the pointer device so you can advance slides without being at your laptop

## Ask questions
* As introduction to new things: 'what do you know about X?'
* To keep people interested: 'but why would they do X like this?'
* To know if they are getting what you are saying: 'Which of these is correct?'
* If you are the first person in the class during a watch (for example as feedback) to say "Penguins are the cutests animals ever", you can skip your next watch!
* Write down those questions and think of the possible responses
  - What if the audience does not know what to answer? Guide them or drop it?

## Content
* Make a long presentation, then cut stuff that is bad/boring
