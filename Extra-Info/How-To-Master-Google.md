# Master Google

Here are a couple tips to master your google searching skills:

## Search in English
English is **The** language of the world
The chance of you find anything in dutch regarding your search is way smaller then in English.


## Quotation marks and remove specific info
Using quotation marks in google search will search for those EXACT words on websites.
This can be very handy when looking for error codes. But always start without qoutes.

Ex.:
```
"Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/to/geeklog/public_html/config.php:581) in /path/to/geeklog/public_html/system/lib-sessions.php on line 180"
```

You could copy paste that into the google search bar, break it down into the core words, remove the stuff that is specific to your files,
wrap it in quotation marks and look it up:

Ex.:
```
"Cannot modify header information â€“ headers already sent by"
```

You should always remove info that is not important like line numbers or file names (at least if you named the file).


## Searching on a specific site
Type "site:" followed by the url of the site you wish to search on.
For example you could search the above line of text and limit results to stackoverflow.com
You can also use this to see what is indexed of your site by not typing any keywords.

Bv.
```
site:stackoverflow.com "Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by"
```


## Who is linking to my site?
Bv.
```
link:yoursite.be
```


## Find related sites
Bv.
```
related:pixeline.be
```


## Add the language/framework you use
If you are looking to solve issues with your coding always try to write in front of the search which language you are using.
That will limit results to that language

Bv.
```
php array push
javascript array push
sql joint tutorial
react why does it not refresh
```


## Improve your search step by step
Improve your google search step by step and come closer to the perfect answer gradually to learn more about the process.

Bv.
```

php array push
php array splice
```

## What would the website you are looking for use as words?
Use a professional way of writing, no abreviations, official words,...

Bv.
`looking for a job in Antwerp` ->`Jobs developer Antwerp`


## Stay with your sources
Look for website that tailor to your type of learning & reading & discovering, from w3schools to stackoverflow, lots of sites offer alternatives and they do it for a reason ;)
